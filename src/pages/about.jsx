          As a computer science and engineering professional, I am deeply passionate about the 
          intersection of software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. 
          My interest in these fields stems from my background in math, analytics, and management, 
          which led me to pursue an undergraduate degree in Robotics and Automation. 
          Through this program, I developed a keen interest in building software and machine learning 
          for various applications, from robots and industrial software to autonomous cars. 
          I quickly realized the vast potential of software and machine learning in various industries, 
          and knew that I wanted to pursue a career in this field.

          Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from the University of California, 
          San Diego, with a focus in artificial intelligence and software engineering. This summer I 
          interned at Dolby Laboratories with the Cloud Media Solutions Research team to drive innovation 
          in cloud-based media technologies.
        
          I am confident that my general problem-solving skills, math background, and fundamental 
          knowledge of computer science will allow me to adapt and excel in any project that aligns 
          with my interests and background. With my skills and passion, I am excited to make a positive 
          impact in the software industry. I am actively seeking full time opportunities starting 
          January/April 2024.
